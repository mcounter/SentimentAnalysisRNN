# Sentiment analysis with SageMaker and PyTorch

The goal of this project - create RNN network for sentiment analysis for move reviews ([IMDb dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)) with help of PyTorch framework. Next train and deploy it with help of Amazon SageMaker cloud engine.

* [SageMaker Project.ipynb](SageMaker\%20Project.ipynb) contains detail instructions to reproduce all necessary steps.
* [report.html](./report.html) contains exported version of Jupyter notebook with results of each step run.
